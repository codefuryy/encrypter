> This is a learning project. Each attempt shows my progress as I learn new Python concepts and learn from mistakes.

# Caesar Cipher Attempt-1

## What I tried
- Wanted to encrypt/decrypt by shifting letters
- Used string.replace() to do it
- Reversed the final result for fun

## Why it didnâ€™t fully work
- Learned that replace() messes up when chaining many changes
- Realized loops will help fix this, learning that next!

## Next step
- Rewrite using loops after I learn them
